        Machine Learning Engineer specialized in Computer Vision, I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems for industrial, medical, and real-time applications.
        <br>
        My expertise covers the full lifecycle of machine learning models: advanced image processing, feature extraction, deep learning architecture design, training, evaluation, optimization, and production deployment.
        <br>
        I primarily work on computer vision problems such as detection, classification, OCR, anomaly detection, and tracking, with a strong focus on robustness, performance, and industrialization.
        <br>
        🔬 Domains: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Industrial AI, Medical Imaging
        🚀 From applied research to production-ready systems
